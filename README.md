# VarPy
VarPy: A python library for volcanic and rock physics data analysis


VarPy is an open-source toolbox which provides a
Python framework for analysing volcanology and rock physics
data. It provides several functions, which allow users to define
their own workflows to develop models, analyses and visualisations.
The goal of the VarPy library is to accelerate the uptake
of computational methods by researches in volcanology and rock
physics. 

In this repository you can find:

- Reading material about VarPy Library presented at two conferences: [Slides-EGU2014](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/VarPy/blob/master/VarPy_EGU2014.pdf), [Paper-PyHPC2014](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/VarPy/blob/master/pyhpc2014_submission_4.pdf), and [Slides-PyHPC2014](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/VarPy/blob/master/pyhpc2014-4-VarPy.pdf)

- varpy modules and packages

- Some datasets (Data and Library directories) to work later with varpy examples (python scripts and notebook)

- Several examples of how to use varpy library [varpy examples](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/VarPy/blob/master/python_scripts)

- Python [Notebook example](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/VarPy/blob/master/Iceland_Tjornes.ipynb),
which shows an example about data exploration and visualization based on the Tjornes fracture zone (Iceland).
This example is explained in all the reading material provided in this repository. 

For trying a varpy example (python script or notebook):

	1) Clone the VarPy repository in your machine
	2) Add the VarPy repository path into the PYTHONPATH (e.g., export PYTHONPATH=/Users/rosa/VarPy)

	3a) Execute the any of the scripts inside the directory 'python_scripts':
                python VarPy_Hierro_Ex1.py
	
	3b) Or execute ipython notebook to open Iceland_Tjornes.ipynb
