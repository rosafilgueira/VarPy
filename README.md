VarPy: A python library for volcanic and rock physics data analysis


VarPy is an open-source toolbox which provides a
Python framework for analysing volcanology and rock physics
data. It provides several functions, which allow users to define
their own workflows to develop models, analyses and visualisations.
The goal of the VarPy library is to accelerate the uptake
of computational methods by researches in volcanology and rock
physics.
