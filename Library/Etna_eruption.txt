Tephra fell in Siracusa 80 km south of the vent during the 9th November episode. The most intense Sub-Plinian magnitude occurred on 23rd December causing abundant lapilli and ash fall on the east flank to the coast, causing many civil defence problems i.e. halting of air and road traffic and damage to vegetation.
21/01/1996	19/08/1996	Summit	NEC			1.4	Four strong fire fountain episodes, one of which (25th June) produced a sustained column 2 - 3 km high.

The pyroclastic episode formed two short reomorphic lava flows, one 0.6 km long eastward, the other 0.4 km long westward. A 0.5 km lon debris flow directed southward formed from the upper slope of the summit cone.  The late explosive activity involved the Bocca Nuova as well, followed by an intense Strombolian activity at the Southeast Crater producing a short southeastward lava overflow.
17/10/1999	05/11/1999	Summit	BN				Lava flow field produced by a series of overfloes from the western rim of the Bocca Nuova, directed westward reaching a maximum length of of 7.5 km. During this period, Bocca Nuova was characterised by intense Strombolian activity.
26/01/2000	29/08/2000	Summit	SEC				Sixty five fire fountain episodes. Paroxysmal eruptive episodes were generally preceded by lava flow emission. During the climax, the eruptive columns reached a maximum height of 6 km, producing lapilli and ash fall on the northeast, east and southeast flanks between Giarre and Catania, also causing some problems to road and air traffic. Lava overflows and flows generated along fractures on the cone slopes were emplaced northeast and eastward in the Valle del Bove and southward. Maximum length reached about 3 km to Mte. Centenari in the Valle del Bove. From 23rd February to March, lava flow emission was continuous from a fracture in the south slope. Lava flows of this period reached and partially covered the Torre del filosofo shelter.

A lava flow 1.1 km long eastward formed from the 3100 m vent, A lava flow 0.7 km long grew eastward from the 3110 m vent. North-northeast 2850 - 2650 m eruptive fissure formed a lava flow field divided in two branches directed southwest (3.8 km long) and southward (3 km long). From the 2550 m vent a main lava flow southward (3.3 km long) destroyed the cable car and the ski-lift and two minor floes (1.9 km and 0.7 km) long grew eastward into the Valle del Bove). A N-S trending eruptive fissure at 2190 - 2060 m formed a lava flow field southward (6.2 km long) reaching 1035 m of elevation. Lava flow cut the S.P. 92 road. Lava flow field from the 2650 m vent (1.9 km long) reaching 2080 m in the Valle del Bove.
27/10/2002	28/01/2003	Flank	S flank	2850-2600			Intense and continuous fire fountain activity between 27th October abd the end of December formed an eruptive column 1 - 4 km high. During this period, ash fall occurred in all directions, but mainly on the eastern flank. 2.5 kg/m2 of ash fell in Catania in two days (28th - 29th October). Ash fell in eastern Sicliy and reached Calabria and Campania, the western coast of Greece and the coast of Libya. Proximal deposits formed two coalescent scoria cones along the N-S eruptive fissure at 2750 m and 2950 m that covered the Torre del Filosofo shelter. The persistent ash fall caused extensive loss to the economy of eastern Sicily because of the prolonged closure of Catania and Reggio Calabria airports, and damage to cultivated areas.
